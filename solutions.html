					<h2>Accessory Dwelling Units</h2>
					<p>Accessory Dwelling Units, also known as ADU’s, are secondary housing units which can be attached or detached to a single family home. ADU’s are usually significantly smaller than its parent home but with all the basic necessities such as a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, etc. ADU’s are a great option to improve the housing crisis in the Bay Area that more citizens should adopt. The median rental price of an ADU is affordable to the median household of two people in the San Francisco Bay Area, ranging from $1925-$2200.</p>
					<p>*affordable - less than 30% of household income</p>
					<p>Visit these resources if you’re interested in creating an ADU out of an existing space.</p>
