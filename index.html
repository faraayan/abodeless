      <h1>Since 2012, housing rates in the Bay Area have risen rapidly, resulting in a housing crisis.</h1>
      <p>If you live in the Bay Area, you’ve likely noticed that housing prices have skyrocketed in the past decade. These unaffordable housing prices have led to poverty, homelessness, pollution, and increased product prices.</p>
      <p>Home prices have been rising for years, with the leading cause being an extreme amount of demand. Job opportunities in small areas like the Bay Area also contribute to the high population density. People crowd around golden job locations, but only a limited number of budget-friendly homes are on the market.</p>

      <h1>Who's affected?</h1>
      <p>Due to the high housing prices in the Bay Area, there is an increased percentage of citizens qualified as cost burdened based on income range. Citizens quality as cost burdened when over 30% of income goes into housing payments. This factor leaves individuals troubled with affording necessities such as food, clothing, transportation, and medical care.</p>
      <p>Let's compare the percentage of cost burdened individuals from two Bay Area cities, San Francisco and San Jose, with the national average.</p>

      <p class = "data">While the percentages of the <15k and 15k-30k income brackets don't have a significant difference, people who make over 30k struggle more in the Bay Area than other areas of the US. The difference comes towards around double or triple more people struggling with cost burden.</p>

      <h1>Public Transportation</h1>
      <p>Here we see the toll fees for different bridges across the US. You'll notice that at the top, we have the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Bay Bridge. Two bridges are located in the Bay Area. It is important to note that all bridges in California have an individual toll fee of $7, but compare that to the rest of the country, and you will notice a big difference. <br> All Bay Area toll bridges only charge in one direction. Both to save commuters time and reduce gridlock in San Francisco.</p>
      <br>

      <br><br>
      <p>One-third of people who use bridges to travel in California, travel on the Bay Bridge alone. Imagine how many commuters must be traveling on other Caltrans-owned Bay Area bridges. </p>
      <p>7897670 people use the BART, that's only 5% of commuters using Caltrans bridges. The average BART fare is $3.50 per individual, this is far less than the individual toll fee of any Caltrans owned bridges.</p>

      <p>This graph represents the different Bay Area Public Transport Systems and how many people use them on a daily basis. The darker orange is the total number of people using public transport, and the orange is the number of people using public transport with incomes under $50k.</p>
      <p>Sam Trans, VTA, SFMTA, and AC Transit have over 50% commuters with incomes under 50k. All of these transit systems, are used more locally, especially in lower income areas of the Bay Area.</p>
      <iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://datastudio.google.com/embed/reporting/00be2696-3985-4a44-97e5-41e776787011/page/bBUzC" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Transportation is the third‐largest budget item for low income households in California’s metropolitan areas. For low income households, only housing and food expenditures  constitute larger budget shares than transportation expenditures.</p>
      <p>"Although low income households may find ways to cover their transportation expenditures, there are trade‐offs that have negative effects on their lifestyles, including increased stress and anxiety about ability to pay, reduced expenditures on  necessities such as food, inability to participate in discretionary activities, and spatial entrapment in the neighborhood around their homes." (Metropolitan Transportation Commission)</p>
      <p>In the Bay area, transportation costs are higher in less dense communities. Due to this, transit services are not as easily accessible. In consequence, these communities have fewer alternatives to the automobile (ex. Napa and Solano counties). On the flipside,transportation costs are lower in  more dense communities where households can use transit to get around, such as San Francisco and Oakland. But the graphs above show that still in San Francisco and Oakland, public transportation is more frequently used in low-income communities.</p>
      <p>"Avoiding or reducing dependency on vehicle ownership has a significant economic benefit for low income households." (Metropolitan Transportation Commission)</p>
