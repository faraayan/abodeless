      <h1>Since 2012, housing rates in the Bay Area have risen rapidly, resulting in a housing crisis.</h1>
      <p>If you live in the Bay Area, youâ€™ve likely noticed that housing prices have skyrocketed in the past decade. These unaffordable housing prices have led to poverty, homelessness, pollution, and increased product prices.\n Home prices have been rising for years, with the leading cause being an extreme amount of demand. Job opportunities in small areas like the Bay Area also contribute to the high population density. People crowd around golden job locations, but only a limited number of budget-friendly homes are on the market.</p>
