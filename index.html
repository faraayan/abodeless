      <h1>We want to give you a closer look at the housing crisis.</h1>
      <p>City infrastructure such as public transportation and school systems in the Bay Area, are widening the wealth and education gap between lower and middle class residents because of high housing rates.</p>

      <h1>Since 2012, housing rates in the Bay Area have risen rapidly, resulting in a housing crisis.</h1>
      <p>If you live in the Bay Area, you’ve likely noticed that housing prices have skyrocketed in the past decade. These unaffordable housing prices have led to poverty, homelessness, pollution, and increased product prices.</p>
      <p>Home prices have been rising for years, with the leading cause being an extreme amount of demand. Job opportunities in small areas like the Bay Area also contribute to the high population density. People crowd around golden job locations, but only a limited number of budget-friendly homes are on the market.</p>

      <h1>Who's affected?</h1>
      <p>Due to the high housing prices in the Bay Area, there's an increased percentage of citizens qualified as cost burdened based on income range. Citizens qualify as cost burdened when over 30% of income goes into housing payments. Being cost burdened makes it difficult for individuals to afford necessities such as food, clothing, transportation, and medical care.</p>
      <p>How does the percentage of cost burdened individuals from the Bay Area compare with the rest of the US? Let's compare.</p>

      <p class = "data-text">While the percentages of the <15k and 15k-30k income brackets don't have a significant difference, Bay Area residents who make 30k-75K financially struggle more than other individuals in the US. The difference comes towards around double or triple more people struggling with cost burdens.</p>

      <h2>Taking public transport</h2>
      <p>Bay Area's dense streets make public transport one of the most efficient ways to move around cities. Some of the most popular public transport systems in the Bay Area are displayed in the graph below.</p>
      <p>We mapped the the relationship between the Bay Area Public Transport Network and the socioeconomic status of people who use them on a daily basis.</p>

      <p class = "data-text">We found that the Sam Trans, VTA, SFMTA, and AC Transit have over 50% commuters with incomes under 50k. All of these transit systems, are used more locally, especially in lower income areas of the Bay Area.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Traveling across bridges</h2>
      <p>On the graph below, we have displayed six of the most used bridges in the US. On the very left we have displayed two of the bridges in the Bay Area: the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge. All the bridges in California have an individual toll fee of $7. However, compared to the rest of the country, this is a large difference.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that all Bay Area toll bridges only charge in one direction. This saves both time and reduces gridlock for commuters.</p>

      <p class = "data-text">We noticed that the bridges in California have an individual toll fee of at least $7. When compared to the rest of the country, with bridges such as the right-most four, this sets forth a large difference.</p>

      <p>Transportation is the third‐largest budget item for low income households in California’s metropolitan areas. For low income households, only housing and food expenditures  constitute larger budget shares than transportation expenditures.</p>
      <p>"Although low income households may find ways to cover their transportation expenditures, there are trade‐offs that have negative effects on their lifestyles, including increased stress and anxiety about ability to pay, reduced expenditures on  necessities such as food, inability to participate in discretionary activities, and spatial entrapment in the neighborhood around their homes." (Metropolitan Transportation Commission)</p>
      <p>In the Bay area, transportation costs are higher in less dense communities. Due to this, transit services are not as easily accessible. In consequence, these communities have fewer alternatives to the automobile (ex. Napa and Solano counties). On the flipside,transportation costs are lower in  more dense communities where households can use transit to get around, such as San Francisco and Oakland. But the graphs above show that still in San Francisco and Oakland, public transportation is more frequently used in low-income communities.</p>
      <p>"Avoiding or reducing dependency on vehicle ownership has a significant economic benefit for low income households." (Metropolitan Transportation Commission)</p>

      <p>When investigating the relationship between education and home location, we found the census data bewteen 2006 and 2010 to reveal that where you live can heavily impact your educational success.</p>
      <p>In the visualization below, we explore this connection based on graduation rates, test scores and independent ratings of academic success.</p>

Thus, educational success can be relatively determined by the district one lives in.</p>
